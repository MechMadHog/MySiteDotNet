# Resources

A curated collection of tools, links, and references I personally use or would recommend.

Whether you're a developer, designer, creative, or curious learner, you'll find something useful here — from software and learning platforms to productivity hacks and design assets.

## Categories
- 🛠 **Developer Tools** – Code editors, browser extensions, CLI utilities  
- 🎨 **Design & UI** – Fonts, color palettes, layout tools, icon libraries  
- 🧠 **Learning Platforms** – Courses, docs, YouTube channels  
- ⚙️ **Productivity & Workflow** – Note-taking, task managers, automations  
- 🌐 **Online Services** – Hosting, version control, deployment platforms  

_This page is always evolving — I’ll keep adding to it over time._
